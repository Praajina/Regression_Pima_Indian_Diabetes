# Regression Analysis on Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for performing regression analysis on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The project focuses on predicting diabetes outcomes based on various medical predictors using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The Pima Indian Diabetes dataset is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It includes the following attributes:

Pregnancies
Glucose
BloodPressure
SkinThickness
Insulin
BMI
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Age
Outcome (0 or 1)
Project Structure
data/: Directory containing the dataset.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Normalize or standardize features if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions and relationships among variables.
Identify correlations and insights.
Model Development:

Implement regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
Tune hyperparameters and select the best model based on evaluation metrics.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Squared Error, R-squared, or Accuracy (for classification).
Compare model performance and choose the most suitable model.
Deployment:

Document findings and insights in Jupyter notebooks.
Share results and visualizations.
